How do I even make a new object? I need a tutorial to make a collidable object that will restart the level.
Inconsistant json files. There's a huge DemoState and then architypes? What do I use?
How do HUD objects?
Why do platforms have a move and jump value?
How do friction values?
Players walking into each other needs to not move the other player
I can sometimes jump twice, sometimes jump 4 times
Platform collider and actual platform are not the same.
The tank seems to jump, then brings up the spring. Is weird
This camera tho. This is definitely not the one we initially designed. What do we do?
I accidentally did debug things and I cant get out. I'm scared help.
The punch goes way too far. Is like double the size of the thing
Gotta move away from the console print. Get it outta here. Can we just print the frame rate at the top left corner in debug draw mode?
Found a wonderful bug - Both tanks punch but don't collide, throws an exception sometimes.
How easy is it for me to add a new level / switch to a new level / change level properties (I want an ice level or something)
