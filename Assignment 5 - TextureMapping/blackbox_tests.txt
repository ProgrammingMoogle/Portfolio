I've included two black box tests to help with testing your code.

(1) TextureBitmapTest.obj
    -- Tests the default and non-default constructors of the 'Texture' class.
    -- To compile from the Visual Studio 2015 command prompt:
           cl /EHsc TextureBitmapTest.obj Texture.cpp Affine.lib
    -- Produces the executable 'TextureBitmapTest.exe'

(2) TextureTransformTest.obj
    -- Tests the uv/UV/RGB functions of the 'Texture' class.
    -- To compile from the Visual Studio 2015 command prompt:
           cl /EHsc TextureTransformTest.obj Texture.cpp Affine.lib
    -- Produces the executable 'TextureTransformTest.exe'

The executables produced can be run from the command line.  Each program will attempt to create, read, modify, and test several random bitmap images.  If the program succeeds, a message to that effect will be printed.  Otherwise a diagnostic will be printed, or the program will crash.

Note that each program will leave behind a bitmap image, which you will need to delete yourself.
